/**
 * The plugin bootstrap file
 *
 * https://github.com/cliffordp/cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate#plugin-structure
 * Introduction to the structure of this plugin's files:
 *
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/class-plugin_data.php - hard-coded information about the plugin, such as text domain
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/class-bootstrap.php - gets the plugin going, including setting required/recommended plugin dependencies
 *
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/frontend - public-facing functionality
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/admin - admin-specific functionality
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/common - functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts
 *
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/common/utilities - generic functions for things like debugging, processing multidimensional arrays, handling datetimes, etc.
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/core - plugin core to register hooks, load files etc
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/customizer - WordPress Customizer functionality
 * cliff-wp-plugin-boilerplate/src/shortcodes - where to create new shortcodes
 *
 * This file is read by WordPress to generate the plugin information in the plugin
 * admin area. This file also includes all of the dependencies used by the plugin,
 * registers the activation and deactivation functions, and defines a function
 * that starts the plugin.
